Let's take a look how you can win Axis and Allies (Europe, Pacific, Global) 2th edition.


== Attack with a larger army

Attack with an overwhelming army, not just to win the battle,
but to minimize your IPC loss.
For example let's presume your 8 tanks are attacking 4 tanks:

Your 8 tanks cause on average 4 hits in the first round,
killing all 4 tanks of the opposition.
But those 4 tanks only have 2 hits on average.
So in the end, you loose 2 tanks less than the opponent.
Given that each tank costs 6 IPC to build,
this gives you a profit of 12 IPC,
near the frontline (right where you want them).

So always attack with a larger army.
Don't pass up the opportunity to attack
a large force with a much larger force,
unless a counterattack is immanent.
