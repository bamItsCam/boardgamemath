  == Calculation details

  === Rolling modifiers

  * The probability of a non-rolling card is not affected by the rolling cards, because we keep drawing if we draw one of those.
  ** Therefore the sum of the probabilities of all cards does not equal `100%`.
  ** But the sum of the probabilities of all non-rolling cards does equal `100%`.
  * The probability of a rolling card is shown as the probability _sum_ a single attack,
  because that's what matters for our average damage output.
  ** Because it's a sum, the probability of a rolling card can go above `100%` in theory, even though we might not draw any.
  *** This is to take account the benefit for when we draw multiple rolling modifiers in the same attack.
  *** For example, in an (impossible) deck of `2` non-rolling cards and `4` rolling cards, the probability sum is `133%`:
  **** The probability of a single rolling card can ignore the other rolling cards (because they cause another draw),
  so we can relax the deck to that 1 rolling card under investigation and the 2 non-rolling cards,
  which makes the probability of a single rolling card `1/3 = 33%`.
  **** Because we have `4` rolling cards, the probability sum is `4 * 33% = 133%`.
  **** This doesn't mean we're guaranteed to draw a rolling card, even though it's above `100%`.
  **** It does mean that _on average_, we'll benefit `133%` from the +1 rolling attack modifier on those `4` cards.
  * Multipliers (such as miss and critical hit) affect rolling modifier damage too.

  == Known issues

  * No indication yet of damage reliability (Average damage suffers from _the flaw of averages_).
  * No support yet for other effect cards
  * No support yet for advantage and disadvantage
