By using link:gloomhavenStaminaCalculator.html[our stamina calculator],
we 've come to the following conclusions:

== Playing lost cards early is very expensive

A 10-cards character, such as a _Brute_, can theoretically play 25 rounds
without taking a long rest:

However, if he plays a lost card before his first rest (short or long),
he effectively loses 4 rounds:

On the other hand, if he plays that lost card near the end of the scenario,
he only loses 1 round (or less):

So avoid burn any cards before your first 2-3 rests.

Exception: High stamina characters such as Tinkerer

== Bleeding cards early is even more expensive

Early on, giving up a card to avoid damage (that doesn't kill you)
is almost never worth it:

Losing a pair of discard cars is even worse.
*Be especially careful in the last round(s) before your first rest*,
when have no hand cards left.
If you need to bleed a pair of discard cards to stay alive, it can ruin you.

The Spellweaver is less impacted by early bleeding, because of her reviving ether.

If your team can't avoid bleeding cards early in the scenario,
let the Tinkerer or Spellweaver take the pain.

== High stamina characters (Tinkerer, ...) play lost cards more often

TODO not all characters are equal

== Low stamina characters (Scoundrel, ...) take long rests more often

Even if the rest of the team doesn't.

TODO not all characters are equal

Renewable items are more useful to the Scoundrel and other low stamina characters,
because they are more likely to do a long rest.
