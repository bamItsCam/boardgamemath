The most common way to lose a game of Gloomhaven is to run out of cards and become exhausted.
Health is less of a problem than stamina,
because you can always avoid damage by throwing away cards.

Let's take a look at the maximum number of rounds you can play before going exhausted.
For example, link:gloomhavenStaminaCalculator.html[the stamina calculator]
shows that a Brute can play a maximum of 25 active rounds:

*Your stamina changes a lot, depending on your character,
how many long rests you take
and especially _when_ you play lost cards (or when you bleed any).*

To avoid premature exhaustion, know these rules:

== Characters differ greatly in stamina

Your character's number of starting cards directly influence how fast you'll become exhausted.
For example, without playing lost cards nor taking long rests,
*a Tinkerer becomes exhausted after 36 rounds, but a Scoundrel already after 20 rounds.*

|===
|Character |Card limit |Max active rounds |Visualization

|Scoundrel |9 |20 a|image::staminaBaseScoundrel.png[link="staminaBaseScoundrel.png" role="thumbnail"]
|Brute, Mindthief |10 |25 a|image::staminaBase.png[link="staminaBase.png" role="thumbnail"]
|Cragheart |11 |30 a|image::staminaBaseCragheart.png[link="staminaBaseCragheart.png" role="thumbnail"]
|Tinkerer |12 |36 a|image::staminaBaseTinkerer.png[link="staminaBaseTinkerer.png" role="thumbnail"]
|Spellweaver |8 |28 a|image::staminaBaseSpellweaver.png[link="staminaBaseSpellweaver.png" role="thumbnail"]
|===

The Spellweaver is a special case: with her _Reviving Ether_ card she can pick up all her lost cards once.
If her timing is right, she can last 28 rounds, longer than half of the starting classes.

Even though these character differences have some consequences (which I'll explain later),
normally a scenario takes 10-15 rounds,
so even the Scoundrel's low stamina of 20 active rounds is plenty,
if you play her cards right...

== Playing lost cards early is very expensive

What's the stamina cost for playing a lost card?

Well, it depends on the timing.
To illustrate, let's presume you're playing a Brute or a Mindthief:

image::staminaBase.png[Stamina base]

If you play a lost card before your first rest,
you effectively loses 4 rounds in the scenario:

On the other hand, if you play the same lost card near the end of the scenario,
you only lose 1 round (or less):

image::staminaPlayLostCardLate.png[Play lost card late]

Each lost card you play early on in the scenario costs you a lot of stamina.
The stamina cost reduces by 1 for:

* every even rest for characters that start with an even number of cards.
* every odd rest for characters that start with an odd number of cards.

Round cost of playing the first lost card:

|===
.2+|Character 8+|Lost card before Xth rest, costs Y rounds
|1th |2th |3th |4th |5th |6th |7th |8th

|Scoundrel |4 2+|3 2+|2 2+|1 |0
|Brute/Mindthief 2+|4 2+|3 2+|2 2+|1
|Cragheart |5 2+|4 2+|3 2+|2 |1
|Tinkerer 2+|5 2+|4 2+|3 2+|2
|Spellweaver 2+|3 2+|2 2+|1 2+|0
|===

So if you're a Scoundrel or a Cragheart,
you might wait until after the 1th or 3th rest to play a lost card.
On the other hand, if you're a Brute, Mindthief, Tinkerer or Spellweaver,
there's no point in waiting until after the 1th rest to play a lost card.

Again, the Spellweaver is a bit special.
In her case, that higher than normal cost, occurs twice:
at the start of the scenario and after you play _Reviving Ether_.
And the cost is only 3 rounds.
Furthermore, there is a moment when playing a lost card actually increases your stamina:
it's best to combine her _Reviving Ether_ with another lost card, that is played first,
so that other card ends up back in your hand, instead of on the discard pile.

So avoid playing your lost cards before the first few rests,
especially if you're a low-stamina character.
On the other hand, if you're a Tinkerer and play 2 lost cards before the first rest,
you still have more stamina left than a Brute, Mindthief and a Scoundrel that didn't play any:

== Bleeding cards early is even more expensive

Early on, giving up a card to avoid damage (that doesn't kill you)
is almost never worth it:

Losing a pair of discard cars is even worse.
*Be especially careful in the last round(s) before your first rest*,
when have no hand cards left.
If you need to bleed a pair of discard cards to stay alive, it can ruin you.

TODO screenshot

The Spellweaver is less impacted by early bleeding, because of her Reviving Ether.

If your team can't avoid bleeding cards early in the scenario,
let the Tinkerer or Spellweaver take the pain.

== A minor stamina potion increases stamina by 1 round

A minor stamina potion allows you to pickup 2 _discarded_ cards once per scenario.
It doesn't return any lost cards, so it's no excuse to play a lost card or bleed early,
because those actions cost you 4+ rounds.

It effectively gives you one extra round.
The real advantage is that you can pick up your best 2 cards and play them an extra time.

== High stamina characters (Tinkerer, ...) play lost cards more often

TODO not all characters are equal

== Low stamina characters (Scoundrel, ...) take long rests more often

Even if the rest of the team doesn't.

TODO not all characters are equal

Renewable items are more useful to the Scoundrel and other low stamina characters,
because they are more likely to do a long rest.
