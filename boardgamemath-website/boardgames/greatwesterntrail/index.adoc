= How to win Great Western Trail
:awestruct-game_id: greatwesterntrail
:awestruct-layout: boardGameBase

Generally speaking, we can play 3 macro strategies, based on the workers we buy in:

* cowboys
* craftsmen
* engineers

Regardless of our main strategy - and which workers we invest in - we need to:

* Buy some cattle to increase our Kansas income and disc abilities.
* Build some houses to do more/better actions per turn and derail other players.
* Advance our train somewhat to decreases taxes on our Kansas income and acquire permantent bonuses.

The cowboy-cattle strategy is the easiest to start with.
But the craftsmen-houses strategy is - by far - the most rewarding to play.

That being said, let's start with the basics:
increase our Kansas income enough to unlock black disc abilities.


== How to increase our Kansas income

In Kansas, we sell our distinct hand cards for the sum of their breeding value.
It's vital to increase this income as soon as possible, because it gives us several advantages:

* More income allows us to hire 2 workers a once, buy better cattle or buy bigger houses.
* Deliver to higher cities:
** Unlock black disc squares. These are vital to get our engine running, to _snow ball_.
** Gain victory points (instead of losing them).

We start with 14 cattle cards (5 gray, 3 green, 3 black and 3 white) and only 4 hand cards.
*If we arrive in Kansas with a perfect hand, we have an income of only 7:*

*Yet, we need an income of at least 10 to unlock the first black disc square, so we're 3 income short!*
To increase income, we can sell better cattle, increase our hand card limit or acquire certificates.
Certificates are mostly a temporarily gain, so let's focus on improving our delivery hand first:

*To significantly increase our income permanently,
we want to buy at least 2 cattle cards and increase our hand limit by 1 early in the game,
even if cattle isn't our main strategy.*
But because we start out with only 4 different card types,
it is useless to first increase our hand limit (to 5 hand cards)
before buying our first cattle card. So buy cattle first.


=== Always buy some cattle early on

Buying cattle is expensive and _that new cattle card ends up in our discard pile_.
We want to buy cattle before we reshuffle our deck the first time,
ideally even just before we reshuffle it.
And we want to go through our deck quickly too,
so that level 3/4/5 cattle card is in our hand when we arrive in Kansas.

Buy a cattle card color that you haven't bought yet,
to combine them more easily when selling them in Kansas.
The cattle cards have victory points too, so buy the ones with more victory points first.


=== Increase our hand limit

Increasing our hand limit is a great investment,
which is definitely worth the additional 5 dollar cost,
because of 2 advantages:

* In Kansas, 1 extra card can sell for 1-5 extra dollars,
which increases not just our Kansas income, but also our victory point income
and the likelihood of placing a black disc square.

* *On the road, it increases the likelihood of selling a green/black/white/gray card
and going through our deck quickly.*
** With 5 hand cards, we have roughly 25% more chance to hold at least one white card than with 4 hand cards.
*** The same 25% roughly applies to other card types (gray/green/black).
*** The chance to hold a specific card type does affect that chance (gray cards have a higher chance),
but not enough to take it into account.
** So we're 25% more likely to be able to sell that white card for 2 dollars before buying a worker.
*** And we're going through our deck faster, so we're more likely to arrive with the expensive cattle in Kansas.

To increase our hand limit, we need to reach a delivery city with a black disc square and pay 5 dollars.
The first one requires an income of 10, the second an income 12.

If we have an income of 10, but our train hasn't reached the first red X yet
but the lack of train progress will cost us an extra 5 dollars, on top of the 5 dollars ability cost,
leaving us flat broke for the next trail. This could waste 3 rounds easily.
It's a good idea to stockpile dollars beforehand to avoid this situation,
including take the 6 dollars for a loss of 6 victory points during your first delivery.

The alternative, using the 10 income delivery for the ability to walk faster, is dangerous:
without that 5th hand card, it is very difficult to reach 12 income later on.
However if we're playing an engineer strategy, we can deliver a black disc to the train track too.


=== Acquire certificates

To bridge the gap between our hand's income and the required 10 income threshold,
certificates are extremely useful.

==== Permanent certificates

From the train track, it's possible to gain up to 3 permanent certificates.
These are worth fighting for, especially if we're playing an engineer strategy.

==== Temporarily certificates

In the beginning of the game, it's worth investing in increasing the certificate marker.
We only spend those one-time-use certificates in Kansas
if it helps reach the 10 income limit to increase our hand limit.
They aren't worth spending to reach 8 income and avoid victory point loss,
unless the rest of our deck is stuff with high value cattle,
so we won't need them next time we're in Kansas.
